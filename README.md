# ForW
OMFIT module ForW
Use for the reconstruction of the impurity profiles in the trace limit. And is able to be coupled to the MyInte module to do the integrated modeling.
The origin module path is /scratch/xiangjian/OMFIT-source/modules/ForW.
Use the TGLF and NEO for turbulence and neoclassical transport, respectively.
Runs quite fast, use 13 core, normally should be less than 10 mins.
No GUI, one template project would be /scratch/xiangjian/OMFITdata/pro_ssy/ConsWpro6e-05.zip
